### Hi there 👋
My name is Ettore and I am a Data Analyst and a Project Manager with a solid background.

I have been managing projects for many years, particularly in the automotive and finance fields, collecting experiences within multinational groups worldwide.

After an initial phase in the financial sector, in 2016 I made a big career change, enthusiastically accepting the challenge to participate in the project to build the first mass-produced electric car: the Tesla Model 3. I spent a long time in California, in Silicon Valley, experiencing first-hand the transformation of the automotive industry from traditional car production to the new electric cars.
Now I am motivated by curiosity to embrace further new challenges in the tech sector. 

With this goal in mind, I decided to implement my hard skills with the Data Analytics Bootcamp organized in Berlin by Ironhack.

Prepared in: Python | Pandas | SQL | Machine Learning| Tableau | MS Office Suite | Excel | Canva | Colab
